# SD-Portfolio-2
There are two branches in this portfolio. The main is the official portfolio, where the other is an alternative to prim I worked on to see if I could implement prim 
with a matrix.

As of 9/4/2021 the adjacencygraph.java still needs a lot of work before it is done. I haven't found the answer to getting it correctly converted yet. Plan b is to start over again with new code.
